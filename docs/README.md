# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management documentation. This centralized README summarizes how we run projects at OctoAcme and links to detailed process guides in this folder.

OctoAcme follows a structured, iterative delivery approach. Work starts with a lightweight initiation (Project One-pager) to confirm the problem, success metrics, stakeholders, and a high-level timeline, then moves into planning where the team breaks work into prioritized backlog items with acceptance criteria and estimates. Execution is cadence-driven — teams use a project board (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done), a Definition of Done, and short iterations to deliver small, testable increments. Releases and deployments follow checklist-driven steps with rollback plans and post-deploy verification, and every project concludes with a retrospective to capture learnings and continuous improvements.

Roles and responsibilities are explicit to ensure clear ownership: Project Managers coordinate delivery, schedules, and communication; Product Managers own outcomes and prioritization; Developers implement and test; QA validates acceptance criteria; and stakeholders provide inputs and approvals. Key artifacts — Project One-pager, roadmap and release plan, backlog with acceptance criteria, risk register, and retrospective action items — live in this repo’s docs and should be kept up to date as the project evolves.

Communication is rhythm-based and templated: daily standups for the delivery team, weekly PM+PdM syncs, weekly delivery syncs for cross-team updates and risk review, and monthly stakeholder updates. Quality assurance is built into the workflow: pull requests include acceptance criteria, automated tests and security scans run in CI, at least one review is required before merge, and releases require pre-release checks, staging smoke tests, and post-deploy verification. For incidents, follow the incident playbook and run a blameless retrospective afterward.
